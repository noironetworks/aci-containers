<p>
  In addition to staticcheck, we provide a number of smaller
  utilities. Some of them are useful for integrating
  staticcheck in your workflows, while others provide
  specific code insights.
</p>

<p>
  All of these utilities can be used manually from the command line,
  but their true purpose is integration with scripts and editors.

<p>
  The rdeps utility takes a list of Go packages and returns their
  reverse dependencies. One application for this tool is Continuous
  Integration and testing only those packages that are affected by a
  commit.
</p>

<p>
  Packages can be provided as arguments, or on standard input if the
  <code>-stdin</code> flag is provided. If the <code>-r</code> flag is
  used, reverse dependencies will be printed recursively.
