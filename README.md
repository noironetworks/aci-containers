## ACI CNI Plugin

The Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) CNI plugin brings the
ACI Networking and Policy model to Kubernetes clusters that reside
on-prem or in the cloud. It is fully open source and relies on the
[Opflex Protocol](https://github.com/opendaylight/opflex) to program
Open vSwitch instances running on the Kubernetes nodes. It provides IP
address management, L2/L3 networking, load balancing, and security
functions for container workloads.
